# Sorter
Console application to sort integers from an input file using the selection or bubble sort algorithms

The app prompts the user for a filename containing integers, then sorts using the selection sort or bubble sort depending on c++ compiled.

The resulting sorted integers are printed to a SelectionOutput.txt or BubbleOutput.txt file.
